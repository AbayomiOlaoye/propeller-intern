# 📖 Propeller-Intern <a name="about-project"></a>

**Propeller-Intern** is an app with major focus on the use of `gh` commandline tools and prompts without relying heavily on abstracting with GitHub's UI in order smoothen collaboration and hasten versioning control systems among developers.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Needed Tools

To avaoid unnecessary difficulty with this project, it's expedient that you have a minimum of the following recommended materials and tools:

- A Code Editor (_e.g. Atom, Visual Studio Code, Bracket, etc._)
- A suitable Command Line Tool/Interface (_e.g. Linux environment, git bash, Windows Sub Linux 1 || 2, etc._)
- Install GIT on your system
- Have basic knowledge of CLI command 

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `git clone`

To make use of this project, kindly do the following:

- Clone this project on your CLI:
```
git clone https://github.com/AbayomiOlaoye/propeller-intern.git
```

- Change directory:
```
cd propeller-intern
```

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
